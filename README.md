# SimplifiedLinkedIn
This is a Simplified LinkedIn web service. It's built with Spring Boot as backend Firstly I have designed whole LinkedIn
database schema, but I am not going to build all LinkedIn features. Just I will stick with user
signup,login,timeline,jobs and user connections features.

Simplified LinkedIn database schema can be found at attached pdf file
